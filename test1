    <title>USTR and USDA Release Report on Agricultural Trade between the United States and China</title>
    <link>https://www.fas.usda.gov/newsroom/ustr-and-usda-release-report-agricultural-trade-between-united-states-and-china</link>
    <description>
  &lt;p&gt;Contact: &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:press@oc.usda.gov&quot;&gt;press@oc.usda.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Washington, DC – The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) today issued a report highlighting the progress made to date in implementing the agricultural provisions in the U.S.-China Phase One Economic and Trade Agreement, which is delivering historic results for American agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Since the Agreement entered into force, the United States and China have addressed a multitude of structural barriers in China that had been impeding exports of U.S. food and agricultural products. To date, China has implemented at least 50 of the 57 technical commitments under the Phase One Agreement. These structural changes will benefit American farmers for decades to come. China also has substantially ramped up its purchases of U.S. agricultural products. To date, China has purchased over $23 billion in agricultural products, approximately 71% of its target under the Phase One Agreement. Highlights outlined in the report include:&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corn:&lt;/strong&gt; Outstanding sales of U.S. corn to China are at an all-time high of 8.7 million tons.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soybeans: &lt;/strong&gt;U.S. soybeans sales for marketing year 2021 are off to the strongest start in history, with outstanding sales to China double 2017 levels.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sorghum:&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. exports of sorghum to China from January to August 2020 totaled $617 million, up from $561 million for the same period in 2017.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pork:&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. pork exports to China hit an all-time record in just the first five months of 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beef: &lt;/strong&gt;U.S. beef and beef products exports to China through August 2020 are already more than triple the total for 2017.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to these products, USDA expects 2020 sales to China to hit record or near-record levels for numerous other U.S. agricultural products including pet food, alfalfa hay, pecans, peanuts, and prepared foods.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;“This China Phase One Agreement is proof President Trump’s negotiating strategy is working. While it took China a long time to realize President Trump was serious, this deal is a huge success for the entire economy. This agreement finally levels the playing field for U.S. agriculture and is a bonanza for America’s farmers, ranchers, and producers,” said U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue. “Being able to participate in this market in a more fair and equitable way has generated more sales that are supporting higher prices and strengthening the rural economy.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;“President Trump delivered on his promise to confront China’s unfair trade practices and expand market opportunities for U.S. agriculture through the Phase One Agreement. Since the Agreement entered into force eight months ago, we have seen remarkable improvements in our agricultural trade relationship with China, which will benefit our farmers and ranchers for years to come,” said U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;USTR and USDA continue to work closely with the Chinese government to ensure that the Phase One Agreement is fully and properly implemented, so that access for U.S. food and agricultural products into the Chinese market can continue to expand moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;For more information, please read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/assets/files/interim-report-on-agricultural-trade-between-the-united-states-and-china-final.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Interim Report on the Economic and Trade Agreement between the U.S. and China&lt;/a&gt; (PDF, 1.3 MB).&lt;/p&gt;

Members of six Agricultural Technical Advisory Committees (ATACs) provide technical advice and guidance on international trade issues that affect both domestic and foreign production in specific commodity sectors. The ATACs focus on trade in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;div&gt;Animals and animal products; &lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;

		&lt;div&gt;Grains, feed, oilseeds and planting seeds;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;div&gt;Processed foods;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;div&gt;Sweeteners and sweetener products; and&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;div&gt;Tobacco, cotton and peanuts.&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be considered for candidacy, applicants must have significant expertise in both agriculture and international trade matters. Committee members, who serve four-year terms, represent a cross-section of U.S. food and agricultural stakeholders. They must be U.S. citizens, qualify for a security clearance, and be willing to serve without compensation for time, travel or expenses. The committees hold frequent conference calls and generally meet in Washington twice a year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title> USDA, FDA Sign MOU to Enhance Collaboration, Efficiency on U.S. Dairy Exports</title>
    <link>https://www.fas.usda.gov/newsroom/usda-fda-sign-mou-enhance-collaboration-efficiency-us-dairy-exports</link>
    <description>
  &lt;p&gt;Contact: AMS Public Affairs, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:PA@usda.gov&quot;&gt;PA@usda.gov&lt;/a&gt;, (202) 720-8998&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	WASHINGTON, Oct. 1, 2020 - Today, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) signed a &lt;span class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;file-icon&quot; alt=&quot;PDF icon&quot; title=&quot;application/pdf&quot; src=&quot;https://www.fas.usda.gov/modules/file/icons/application-pdf.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fas.usda.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fda_usda_dairy_export_certification_mou.final_signed_-_mou_225-20-017_date_10-1-20.pdf&quot; type=&quot;application/pdf; length=1770448&quot;&gt;Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; outlining strengthened coordination between the FDA and the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) to facilitate the export of milk and milk products from the United States. U.S. dairy exports are valued at nearly $6 billion annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The rising trend by trading partners requesting additional information and assurances from dairy exporters requires an exceptional level of coordination by government authorities to address and facilitate requests,” said Frank Yiannas, FDA Deputy Commissioner for Food Policy and Response. “This MOU reflects a concerted, modern approach to leverage our collective strengths as we move into a New Era of Smarter Food Safety.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Signing the MOU is an important milestone in the continued collaboration between USDA and FDA,” stated USDA Under Secretary Greg Ibach, Marketing and Regulatory Programs. “With the MOU in place, USDA and FDA have clearly defined the critical functions needed to assist the dairy industry to improve efficiency and effectiveness by focusing on the core competencies of each agency to engage on certain issues.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USDA Under Secretary for Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs Ted McKinney said, “This MOU will help USDA and FDA address the challenges faced by U.S. dairy exporters and keep them competitive in the global marketplace. I’m confident that it will help facilitate trade and help expand exports of wholesome, high-quality, U.S. dairy products.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FDA is the competent authority providing regulatory oversight of programs that cover U.S. dairy facilities, ensuring the safety of milk and milk products, while the USDA, through its dairy grading service, is the lead agency on issuing dairy sanitary certificates, coordinating interagency collaboration related to U.S. exports of milk and milk products, and negotiating with foreign countries on certifications to meet their importing requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the MOU, USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is the lead agency providing export-related services for milk and milk products and the issuance of more than 55,000 dairy sanitary export certificates annually to more than 125 countries. FAS remains the lead authority for international negotiations on trade of milk and milk products. USDA will manage foreign country facility-specific questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USDA and FDA will collaborate on specific country certificate requirements with FDA maintaining the listing of facilities eligible to export and working with USDA to assess opportunities to develop an electronic platform for sharing information more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;#&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;USDA is an equal opportunity provider, employer, and lender.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Joint Statement from Western Hemisphere Agriculture Leaders</title>
    <link>https://www.fas.usda.gov/newsroom/joint-statement-western-hemisphere-agriculture-leaders-0</link>
    <description>
  &lt;p&gt;Contact: &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:press@oc.usda.gov&quot;&gt;press@oc.usda.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WASHINGTON, Sept. 14, 2020&lt;/strong&gt; – Following the virtual G-20 Agriculture and Water Ministers Meeting hosted by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on Sept. 12, top agricultural officials from five Western Hemisphere countries – Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and the United States – issued the following statement underscoring the importance of maintaining agricultural trade flows during the COVID-19 pandemic and emphasizing their commitment to remaining reliable suppliers of food and agricultural products to the world:&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;“We, the Agriculture Ministers of Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and the United States, express our deepest condolences for the tragic loss of life being endured around the world as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and convey our strong appreciation for all workers in the health, agricultural and other front-line sectors, who selflessly dedicate their efforts to the benefit of others.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;“As we face the effects of this crisis, reliable and resilient agricultural supply chains remain essential to guarantee the availability of safe, nutritious food around the world. Our nations have taken the measures necessary to keep agricultural supply chains operational, ensuring the continued production and distribution of safe, quality products, while safeguarding the health and welfare of agricultural sector workers. We are open for business and you can count on us for safe and high-quality food.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;“As Western Hemisphere agricultural leaders, whose countries represent 35 percent of global exports in agricultural products, we reiterate the importance of maintaining agricultural trade flows, while avoiding unjustified trade-restrictive measures, in order to keep markets open and ensure global food security, especially to those most vulnerable. We underscore the guidance published by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization and the World Health Organization on April 7, 2020, which states, ‘there is no evidence to date of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses being transmitted via food or food packaging,’ and we call on trading partners to allow trade to flow without undue delay or unjustified requirements.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;“We will continue to work with our partners and with relevant regional and international organizations to exchange information, enhance coordination, and strengthen our global response to the crisis.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;“Looking at the aftermath of this pandemic, we recognize that agriculture will be an important engine for economic recovery. Innovation and technological development will be vital to guarantee that food systems develop sustainably to feed the world’s growing population. How we emerge from this crisis will be our greatest legacy for a future of global food security and nutrition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;#&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
